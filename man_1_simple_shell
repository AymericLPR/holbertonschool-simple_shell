.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a command line interpreter that reads and implements basic commands from user input as a shell would.

.SH USER INPUT
Once a user inputs a command and hits enter, the shell performs the following actions:

1. Splits the command into an array of words.

2. Looks for the command.

3. Executes the command.

.SH SEARCH FOR COMMAND
When locating a command, the shell looks for a built-in command by that name.
If a built-in command is not found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.

.SH EXECUTE COMMAND
Commands are executed in a child process of the main process.

.SH BUILTINS
.IP exit
Exits the simple_shell.
